Hello everybody!! This is an encryption framework for making partially
encrypted configuration files called concr.

INSTALLATION:

in the directory that you extracted concr run these commands:

$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install

and that's it!!!

look at the confcrypt man-page for information as a user. Look at 
the libconcr man-page for information as a developer.

$ man confcrypt
$ man concr_rd
$ man concr_getkey

if you like you can run these commands if you want to read the manual
before installing

if you're on a bsd:

$ mandoc confcrypt.1 
$ mandoc decrypt.3 
$ mandoc getkey.3

if you're on linux:

$ man -l confcrypt.1 
$ man -l decrypt.3 
$ man -l getkey.3
